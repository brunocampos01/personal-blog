TODO

I've always been enthusiastic on learning about computation. For this reason, I have look for opportunities to gain experience from my work and achieve perfection in it.

I am currently focused on creating and developing Big Data solutions with a focus on performance and scale using DevOps culture.
I also worked on artificial intelligence projects where I developed knowledge of analytical techniques how, information retrieval, machine learning, time series.
